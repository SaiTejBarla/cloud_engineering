Day 2 - Core Cloud Services

1. Compute (Brains of the cloud) - 
	> Compute = processing power.
	> Used to run applications, websites, scripts.
	
	Types - 
		> VMs (virtual machines) -> like renting a full computer in a 		  in a cloud. (AWS, AZURE VMS).


		> Serverless Functions -> run code without managing servers

             
                > Containers -> lightweight, portable apps, (Docker, 			  Kubernetes).

                > Example - Running a Python Flask app on a VM.

2. Storage - Where data lives
	Types -
		> Object Storage (files, images, videos) -> AWS S3, GCP 		CLOUD STORAGE, AZURE BLOB.

		> Block Storage (hard disk for a virtual machine best for OS, DATABASES)

		> File Storage ( shared file system across machines).

	Example - Uploading a photo to Gogle Drive = Object Storage.

3. Networking ( Roads of the Cloud) - 
	
	Networking refers to how resources talk to each other & the internet.

	Key concepts:
		IP Adddress -> unique identifier for a machine.

		DNS -> converts domain name into IP (google.com -> 	
		142.655.xxx)

		VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) -> your private network inside 		cloud

		Load Balancer -> Distributes traffic across multiple 			servers.

		Firewall -> Allows or Blocks network traffic.
	Example - If you run a website on virtual machine, a firewall rule 	must allow HTTP (port 80).

4. Databases (Brains + Memory) -
	Databases store structured data.
	Types -
		1. RSQL
		2. NOSQL
	Uses - 
		1. SQL - best for transactions (bank, ecommerce).

		2. NOSQL - best for flexible, large-scale apps (chatbots, 		Iot).
