What is cloud computing?
We rent servers over internet instead of buying physical servers where,
  1. we don't worry about hardware failures
  2. you pay only for what you use
  3. you can scale up/down immediately

Example - 
  Traditional - you buy a laptop with 1TB storage
  Cloud - Just rent 100GB storage from Google Drive. If you need more  	 	  tomorrow, you upgrade instantly


Key Benefits of cloud -
	On-demand - The resources are available instantly
	Scalable - add/remove resources as needed
	Cost-Efficient - pay only for what you use
	Global access - services are available world wide
	Managed Services - databases, networking, backups are handled by 	 	           cloud provider


Service Models in Cloud-
There are 3 main models:

1. Iaas (Infrastructure as a Service) -
	1. Raw computing resources (VMs, storage, networking).
	2. Example - AWS EC2, Azure VM, GCP Compute Engine
	3. You manage OS, runtime, app

2. Paas (Platform as a Service) -
	1. Platform for developers to deploy apps quickly.
	2. Example - GCP APP ENGINE, Azure App Service, HEROKU.
	3. Cloud manages OS & runtime, you manage the app code.

3. SaaS (Software as a Service) - 
	1. Ready-to-use Software
	2. Example - Gmail, Google Docs, Office 365.
	3. We just use it, nothing to code or manage infra
