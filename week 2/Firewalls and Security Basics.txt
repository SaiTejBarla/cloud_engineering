Firewalls and Security Basics 

What is a Firewall?
A firewall is like a security guard for our servers/applications.
It controls who can enter (inbound traffic) and who can leave (outbound traffic)
Works using rules (allow/deny traffic)

Firewall Rules in Cloud - 
You define rules-
		Allow SSH(port 22) only from your IP
		Allow HTTP(port 80) for everyone
		Deny all others

Inbound rules - Who can send traffic to your VM
Outbound rules - Where your VM can send traffic


3. Example

Suppose you deploy a VM running a website:

To make it accessible:

Add rule → allow TCP 80 (HTTP) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).

To access via SSH from your laptop:

Add rule → allow TCP 22 (SSH) from your laptop’s IP (e.g., 106.67.xx.xx).

To secure database:

Allow only traffic from VM’s private IP, block internet access.

🔹 4. Cloud Examples

AWS: Security Groups + NACLs

GCP: VPC Firewall Rules

Azure: Network Security Groups (NSG)

🔹 5. Hands-On (Free Tier Idea 💡)

Create a VM.

Add a firewall rule to allow port 80 (HTTP).

Host a small static page (like “Hello Cloud”).

Test:

Open browser → enter VM’s public IP → see your site.

Remove firewall rule → try again → blocked.

That’s how firewall works! 🔒
