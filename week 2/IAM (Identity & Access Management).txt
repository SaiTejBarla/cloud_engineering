IAM (Identity & Access Management)

IAM = “Who can do what on which resource.”

It controls users, roles, and permissions in cloud.

Example:

User A can only view storage buckets.

User B can start/stop VMs.

Service Account (non-human identity) can access DB.

📌 In AWS: IAM Users, Roles, Policies.
📌 In GCP: IAM Roles, Service Accounts, Policies.
📌 In Azure: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

2️⃣ Firewall vs Security Groups

Firewall Rule: Controls inbound/outbound traffic (IP, Port, Protocol).

Security Group (AWS): Same idea but attached to resources (EC2).

Example:

Allow only port 22 (SSH) for your IP.

Allow port 80 for everyone (public website).

3️⃣ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

A virtual network inside the cloud.

Contains subnets, firewalls, routing tables.

Similar to how your home Wi-Fi has private IPs and only your router connects to the internet.

You isolate and secure resources here.

📌 In AWS: VPC
📌 In GCP: VPC Network
📌 In Azure: Virtual Network (VNet)

4️⃣ Hands-On / Free Practice

Even without AWS/GCP paid accounts, you can practice with:

Local networking tools (ping, traceroute, netstat).

Use Play with Docker / Katacoda (free sandboxes) to simulate networking.

Write iptables/firewall rules in Linux VM (if you set one up).
