Networking Basics 

IP Address - An IP Address is like a "House address" for your computer/server on a network

Two main types:
IPv4 - 192.723.2.34 ( most common, but limited supply)
IPv6 - 2001:0d33:34df::2d56:9fh7:99jg ( newer, much larger address space).

Types in cloud -
Private IP - Internal, only accessible inside your network
Public IP = Accessible from the internet


DNS (Domain Name System) -
DNS = Coverts human readable names into IPs
Example - google.com -> 142.250.183.206


Load Balancers - A Load Balancer spreads incoming traffic across multiple servers/VMs

Example - 1000 users -> instead of all hitting a 1VM, traffic gets distributed to 3 Vms

Benefits - High availability ( if 1 VM fails, others handle)
Scalability 


Firewalls - Firewalls are protections walls for our servers.
Define rules to allow or block traffic
Example rules in cloud :
	Allow Inbound HTTP (port 80) traffic
	Allow SSH (port 22) only from your IP
	Block everything else

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - A personal network within the cloud 
Example - You are having a personal network within Google Cloud/Azure/AWS where you can create subnets, firewalls, routing rules
