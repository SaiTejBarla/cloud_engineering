Compute in Cloud 

Whenever you run software, you need compute power ( CPU + RAM). 
Cloud providers give this in different ways 

1. Virtual Machines(VMs) - Its a IaaS type (INfrastructure as a Service). Its like renting a computer in the cloud.
You choose -
	OS, Cpu & RAM sizes ( like 2vCPUs, 4GB RAM), Disk Storage ( SSD, HDD)

You are responsible for -
Installing software (Python, Java, Nginx, etc).
Managing security patches.
Backups, scaling.

2. Serveless Compute - 
You dont manage servers at all.
You only upload your code -> the cloud runs it when needed.
You are only billed for what you are used.

Examples - AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions/Cloud Run, Azure Functions


3. Autoscaling - 
CLoud can automatically add/remove servers based on traffic
Example -
	Your website usually has 100users/day -> 1VM is enough.
	Suddenly 100,000 users come -> Cloud auto creates more VMs
	When traffic drops, extra VMs are removed -> you save money.

Example - E-commerce sites during mega sales.
